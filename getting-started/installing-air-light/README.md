# Installing Air-light

{% hint style="info" %}
The documentation here at docs.airwptheme.com is still under construction. Please head over to [Wiki](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/air-light/wiki) in the meantime. Thank you for your patience!

There are multiple ways to install Air-light. As it is built by a digital agency, we have our own tools.
