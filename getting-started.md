description: How to start creating WordPress theme based on Air-light.

# Getting started

### Please note before using

Air-light is **not** meant to be used as a Parent Theme! Just like its inspiration \_s, Air-light is a theme meant for hacking, which means instead of creating a chidl theme for it try turning it into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what it's all about.

Air-light has a minimal CSS theme with all the basics covered. It's more than just a skeleton, it has all the needed opionated resets, typography sizing, spacings, form items like buttons, navigation patterns, simplicity kept in mind. You can continue from there in your own theme...

Air-light is not meant to be _"a theme for everyone"_, which means it doesn't have all the parts that are generally included in "multi-purpose" themes for non-technical people (please see [Disabled features](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/air-light#disabled-features)).

If you want to use this theme as starter for your new theme, please note the theme won't necessarily be that much fun or won't look good by default and needs work from you. We recommend using [Sage](https://roots.io/sage/) if you need something more extended.
