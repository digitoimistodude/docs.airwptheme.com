# ✈ Air-light

## Introduction

Air-light (or simply _Air_) is designed to be a ultra minimal starting point for a WordPress project at [Digitoimisto Dude Oy](https://www.dude.fi), a Finnish boutique digital agency in the center of Jyväskylä. Theme is originally based on [\_s](https://github.com/automattic/\_s). We welcome all happy contributors with open arms!

### Mission & vision

Air-light is built to be very straightforward, backwards compatible, front-end developer friendly and modular by its structure. Following [Underscores](https://github.com/automattic/\_s) and [WordPress Theme Coding Standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme\_Development#Theme\_Development\_Standards) best practices and most of the changes in \_s are implemented as soon as they are committed.

**Our mission and goal** is **minimalism** and **simplicity**. **Our vision** is to build a theme that will not implement its own wrappers or functions, will not use any templating languages that would take things further from traditional PHP or CSS, will contain nothing that people will not use or need. Air-light will be free of weird "app-like" folder structures or odd syntaxes that nobody else uses. We love WordPress as it was and as it is.

Air was renamed to air-light in version 3.7.8 (March 20th, 2018), because _air_ was already taken in the official WordPress theme directory.
